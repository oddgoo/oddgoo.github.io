I am a Creative Coder and Game Designer with an appetite for experimentation and the poetics of space. I co-founded the [villavanilla](http://www.villavanilla.com) game studio in Guadalajara, Mexico. I am currently based in Sydney, Australia.

I find joy in continously researching and attempting to understand frameworks, technologies and art.

I have participated in several finalist and award winning projects such as 2010 IGF's "Next Great Mobile Game" with *[Depict](http://oddgoo.io/depict-2/)* and 2008's MochiAds "Become a Rock Star" flash game contest with *[Amberial Nebulosa](http://oddgoo.io/amberial-nebulosa/)*.
