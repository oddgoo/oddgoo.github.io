Hello, my name is Jesus "oddgoo" Moreno and this is my game development journey so far. all feedback is appreciated and I'll be happy to answer any questions if anything in the story is relevant to your efforts. I will keep things human and personal to Genesis I was born 23 years ago in Guadalajara, Mexico. My childhood was mix of being the youngest of 6 siblings and the typical lonely kid experience of constantly immersing in his own imagination and games (my brothers' amiga 500 gave me giana . up until i was about 12 years old, most of my day would be spent imagining my surroundings as environments from hypotetical videogames and acting out my fantasies (I still remember many of them, some lasted even months! ). of course, to an observer i was nothing more than a child making weird sounds and jumping around like a madman instead of choosing to play soccer with the other kids, which earned me a good amount of mockery. funnily enough, even tho i was completely obsessed with games, the thought omf being a game never seriusly crossed my mind. my aspirations ranged from studying nowadays i appreeciate having all that, and my siblings, as it all benefits The year that changed it all Oh the Drama A screeching right-hander What's next? My questions Does anyone here have any experience or advice for teaching programming or game design? Asuper long-shot but, does anyone have any advise regarding sponsorship in Australia?
